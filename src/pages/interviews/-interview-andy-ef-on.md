**RR: Hey Andy. We gather that your love for music started with playing the piano. Was it an easy transition into DJing?**

Andy: Firstly I would like to say well done for what you guys are doing in the music scene in [Sydney](https://www.ravereviewz.net/Events-Location/Sydney), the continuous support and also thanks for having me. 

I was intrigued with all aspects of music from a young age, especially melodic elements. A family member suggested I have a go at playing the keyboard when I was about 7 years old and they noticed that musically I can hear a melody and replicate it. I would improvise on the keyboard and this eventually led me to start taking up piano lessons at a young age. The idea of DJing stemmed from watching a lot of credible DJs during the late '90s and early '00s on TV and reading more about them. I became obsessed in a way and soon after started exploring different types of electronic music.

**RR: Being from Cairo originally, what musical influences were you exposed to there? Do you think it has shaped you as an artist today?**

Andy: As a culture I have personally found that Egyptians have a good understanding of music and how it affects us, be it happy, sad or excited. There is also the Arabic music scale which has a very different feel when it is played or what people often refer to as the "Middle Eastern" sound, can be very emotive. Also techno tapes were available in the late '90s and had an influence on my exposure to electronic music at the time. Following that I started exploring compilations by the likes of Sasha, Nick Warren, Dave Seaman, John Digweed, Seb Fontaine, Deep Dish, Hernan Cattaneo, Paul Oakenfold and also the Global Underground, Nubreed and Renaissance compilations series were a solid foundation to my current musical tastes and upbringing.

**RR: Is it true that you signed your first track ‘Identity Replikation’ when you were just 18?? Talk us through how that came about.**

Andy: After learning to play the piano I was curious to learn how to integrate a MIDI keyboard with my computer as a sequencer and stumbled upon Propellerhead's 'Reason' in an interview with Sasha. I managed to grab myself a copy of it and went through the process of teaching myself how to use a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) from programming drums, processing sounds, writing my own melodies, mixing and mastering. When making the move to Sydney, Australia I felt I was capable enough to produce music of a good enough quality and began writing numerous tracks and sending it to friends around the world who are DJs and producers. 'Identity Replikation,' believe it or not, was finished in a couple of hours which surprises me now that I look back on it., I only found out after a couple of months that a New York based DJ had been opening his sets with it for so long and he approached me to sign it to his 'Acute Recordings' label.

**RR: This year saw you and [Zankee Gulati](https://magazine.ravereviewz.net/interview/zankee-gulati-bootz-n-catz) launch a new night called Forbidden TØNË. What's the concept behind the brand? Any more nights planned?**

Andy: Forbidden TØNË is a brand which we created to expose people to that niche underground "progressive house" style of music. Although, mind you, progressive is not a sound and it is more the notion that the music develops across a track. It can be a melody, atmospheric pad sounds, rhythms or vocal sample. Progressive comes in many forms from the laid back, deeper style to more heavy sounds.

**RR: We loved your headline set at the SLYFOX - tell us about the experience and your history with the club.**

Andy: My history with SLYFOX goes a while back before the current owners took over. It always had a special vibe and atmosphere, although music programming and the ambience was nothing compared to what it is now. I have always pictured it being what it is today and certainly there has been a lot of hard work and upgrades over time, now its characterised by its signature lampshades, excellent Funktion 1 sound system and great vibes.

**RR: You're a [Return to Rio](https://magazine.ravereviewz.net/interview/ricky-cooper/) resident - can you tell us your best memories from past Rio events? Any hints for us on what's planned for this year’s festival??**

Andy: I fell in love with the first Return to Rio I went to when Dixon played a 4 hour closing set, which was such an amazing experience for me and also noticing that the Rio team had such passion for good underground acts. The Return to Rio team strive to improve every year and create such a fun and special atmosphere. 
<br><br>

**RR: We regularly listen to your promo mixes on Soundcloud. Is there a process that you follow when curating them each month?**

Andy: The monthly promo mixes I started back in 2014 are a reflection of my favourite music that I personally feel I should present to people in the form of a mix set. I personally enjoy curating them as every month I go through a lot of music and its always exciting hearing new tracks then working out a flow for the set to present to people, which is always a fun and rewarding process.
<br><br>

**RR: If we asked you to look back through your career and pick the most memorable set you've played, which would it be?**

Andy: That I have to say is a tricky question, but I would pick the [Blueprint](https://magazine.ravereviewz.net/interview/ben-nott-blueprint) office tower party on Boxing Day 2015 due to its unique location and concept. I might never experience a full on party in an office block in the middle of the city.
