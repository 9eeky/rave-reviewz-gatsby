_Our chat with _

We gather that your love for music started with playing the piano. Was it an easy transition into DJing?

I was intrigued with all aspects of music as a young age, especially melodic elements. A family member suggested I have a go at playing the keyboard when I was about 7 years old and they noticed that musically I can hear a melody and replicate it on the keyboard. Often I would improvise but all this was prior to any training  and eventually led me to start taking up piano lessons. The idea of DJing actually stemmed from watching a lot of credible DJs during the late 90s and early 00s on TV. I read more about them and became obsessed in a way that started my exploration different types of electronic music.

Being from Cairo originally, what musical influences were you exposed to there? Do you think it has shaped you as an artist today?

As a culture I have personally found that Egyptians have a good understanding of music and how it affects us; be it happy, sad or excited. There is also the Arabic music scale which has very different feel when it is played or what people often refer to as the "middle eastern" sound can be very emotive. I started exploring compilations by the likes of Sasha, Nick Warren, Dave Seaman, John Digweed, Seb Fontaine, Deep Dish, Hernan Cattaneo, Paul Oakenfold. The Global Underground, Nubreed and Renaissance compilations series were also a solid foundation to my current musical tastes and upbringing.

Is it true that you signed your first track ‘Identity Replikation’ when you were just 18?? Talk us through how that came about.

Shortly after learning to play the piano, curious to learn how to integrate a MIDI keyboard with my computer as a sequencer, I stumbled on Propellerhead's 'Reason' in an interview with Sasha and managed to grab myself a copy of it. I went through the process of teaching myself how to use a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) from programming drums, processing sounds, writing my own melodies, mixing and mastering. Once I moved to Sydney, I felt I was capable enough to produce music of a good enough quality and began writing numerous tracks and sending it to friends around the world who were DJs and producers friends. Believe it or not, 'Identity Replikation' was finished in a couple of hours which surprises me when I look back on it. I only found out after a couple of months that a DJ based in New York had been opening his sets with it and he approached me to sign the track to his 'Acute Recordings' label.

This year saw you and Zankee Gulati launch a new night called Forbidden TØNË. What's the concept behind the brand? Any more nights planned?

Forbidden TØNË is a brand which we created to expose people to that niche underground "progressive house" style of music, mind you progressive is not a sound and it is more the notion that the music develops across a track, can be a melody, atmospheric pad sounds, rhythms, vocal samples etc thus progressive comes in many forms from the laid back, deeper style to more heavy sounds. Our next show is on the 2nd of June with TIM GREEN (Cocoon) with our good friends from MOTIF and KILTR.

You're a Return to Rio resident - can you tell us your best memories from past Rio events? Any hints for us on what's planned for this year’s festival??

I think I fell in love with the first Return to Rio I went to, that was when Dixon played a 4hrs closing set which was such an amazing experience for me and also noticing that the R2R team had such passion for good underground acts, fun and atmosphere made me love it even more. The Return to Rio team strive to imporove every year, lets just say I heard some things about this year's surprises so all I can say is it will be magical.

We loved your headline set at The Sly Fox - tell us about the experience and your history with the club.

Hey RR, firstly I would like to say well done for what you guys are doing in the music scene in Sydney, the continuous support and also thanks for having me. The SLYFOX history goes a while back before the current owners took over, it always had a special vibe / atmosphere, although music programming and the ambiance was nothing compared to what it is now. I have always pictured it being what it is today and certainly there has been a lot of hard work and upgrades over time, now its characterized by its signature lampshades, excellent FUNKTION 1 sound system and great vibes.

We regularly listen to your promo mixes on Soundcloud. Is there a process that you follow when curating them each month?

The monthly promo mixes I started back in 2014 are a reflection of my favourite music that I personally feel I should present to people in the form of a mix set, I personally enjoy curating them as every month I go through a lot of music and its always exciting hearing new tracks then working out a flow for the set to present to people which is always a fun and rewarding process.
<br><br>

If you asked you to look back through your career and pick the most memorable set you've played, which would it be?

That I have to say is a tricky question, but I would have to pick the Blueprint Office Tower Party Boxing Day 2015 due to its unique location and concept, certainly I might never experience a full on party in an office block in the middle of the city.

Finally, looking forward through the coming months, what have you got planned?
