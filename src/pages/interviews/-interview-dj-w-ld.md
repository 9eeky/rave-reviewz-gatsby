\*\*RR: Guillaume, welcome back to \[Sydney](_\_\_). The last time you were here was two years ago, what memories do you have of that trip? And what can we expect from your set at the \[Subsonic launch party](\_\_)?\*\*

\*\*DJ W!ld:\*\* It was fantastic! I played great parties but unfortunately I didn’t get time to visit around as I had to play another city the following day. I’m lucky that this time I'm staying for a week so I will be able to explore. One thing is sure: all the parties I’ve previously played in Sydney were bomb! The Australian crowd is always top vibe! I'm really happy to comeback and can’t wait to play at the Subsonic Festival Launch… be ready for a nice travel to my universe :)

\*\*RR: We gather that your first love was hip hop and your name DJ W!ld is a homage to the classic hip-hop film Wild Style. Did you ever get in to graffiti and b-boying? And who were your favourite rappers from those days?\*\*

\*\*DJ W!ld:\*\* Yes I’m into graffiti and still do it in my free time. My favourite rappers back then were Gang Star, Black Moon, Das EFX, Bahamadia, De La Soul, Tribe Called Quest…

\*\*RR: Now, you relocated to Paris in the 90s during the 'French Touch' explosion. Did you make a conscious decision to steer clear of the more commercial sound associated with that movement?\*\*

\*\*DJ W!ld:\*\* Yes of course it always been like this, steering clear of this "movement"  that didn’t actually represent what the real French touch was about.

\*\*RR: You were a resident at DC10's \[Circoloco](\_\_), which led to \[Sven Väth](\_\_) inviting you into the Cocoon family. Has he been an influential figure for you and your music?\*\*

\*\*DJ W!ld:\*\* Sven has been influential for many reasons, he’s a show-man, his longevity in the business, all what he brings for our movement. He’s Papa Sven :) for the music I had different influences.

\*\*RR: Your upcoming release on your \[Dailycid Music](___) imprint - 006, features tracks from Liam Geddes, Stk Ensemble, Nima Gorji, Kevin Cook and yourself. How did you decide on this selection of producers? Would you say there's a theme that connects the tracks?

\*\*DJ W!ld:\*\* I selected the tracks to have a VA with 4 tracks that are really different but also fit together…It's slightly difficult to explain. It's only my point of view, no theme in particular. I'm always scouting new talent and mixing with friends and other artists I follow - just good underground music. 

\*\*RR: We like your upbeat offering 'Apres Minuit' on the release. Can you talk us through the concept behind it and the production process\*\*

\*\*DJ W!ld:\*\* This track was made at the first edition of SXM FESTIVAL in St Marteen in a hotel room during the after party, just before my set at \[Jamie Jones](__)' Paradise Party. There I realised it was worked really well on the dance floor. You can check out this video from that day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1PmLgngBaQ

\*\*RR: We know you've also composed soundtracks for fashion shows run by the likes of Vivienne Westwood and Christian Lacroix. Do you consider fashion an art form similar to music in its nature? Or do you think it's fair to say that it's more superficial?\*\*

\*\*DJ W!ld:\*\* Yes of course fashion has got lots of talented artists…same as in music industry actually. Someone will say it's more superficial but our world is really superficial for sure and fashion and music are big part of it.

\*\*RR: The past month has seen you play in Spain, Switzerland, Italy and Malaysia! How do you cope with such a busy touring schedule and find time to relax?\*\*

\*\*DJ W!ld:\*\* I don’t find much time to totally relax but all what i‘m doing is by passion so I give a lot of energy and then to relax I make a lot of music, painting or designing jewellery & stuff…

\*RR: And of all the sets you've played over the years, which one stands out in your memory the most?\** 

\*\*DJ W!ld:\*\* Really difficult to name only one for many different reasons. My first gig ever, at Twilo in New York, was at 20 years old. My first sitting at DC10 Ibiza. Most of the time it's just several factorz aligning together such as an amazing crowd, top club and good sound system :)

\*\*RR: Finally - what's on your agenda for the rest of 2018?\*\*

\*\*DJ W!ld:\*\* I’ve recently joined a new agency, they understand me and we’re moving forward swiftly. I'm really looking forward to my upcoming shows in Ibiza, Sonar, South America tour, US tour, ADE and Asia tour. Release wise, below (maybe I sign a few more still tbc)
