**RR:** Hey Ian! You were in Sydney last month and played at SLYFOX and SASH - two very different settings. How did you find them?

**Ian:** I’ve played SASH a few and recently also SASH by day . SASH by day is a lot of fun , really energetic and fun crowd . This time it started raining heavily in the middle of my set , it was crazy ! We had to move the booth , set up umbrellas and wipe the CDJs all while i was playing . The crowd was phenomenal , they went crazy …hahaha ! I played Sly Fox for the first time this time and it was very nice . The venue is more intimate and you are really close to the crowd , i like that . The sound system is great too !

**RR:** The last time you were in Australia was 2 years ago. How was the experience? 

**Ian:** Very nice . I played Something Else at Burdekin first and the SASH by day and by night . Really cool

**RR:** You run 2 successful labels, Pooledmusic and Montage - focusing on house and techno, respectively. What are the challenges you face in managing the two?

**Ian: **I’d say finding new talent , people who haven’t released much previously and who relate to my own sound . Indira Paganotto is a perfect example for that. Her tracks always sound that they could’ve been produced by me

**RR:** You also have some serious kit in your studio - can you tell us about your most prized piece of equipment? 

**Ian: **The Akai MPC 3000 is the heart of my studio , it controls all my synthesizers and drum machines and i use it in every track

**RR: **You’ve released many tracks and remixes over the years - do you have a personal favourite?

**Ian: **Not really , too many to mention and with a lot of them i have special memories

**RR:** Your 1998 Meridian album is well-recognised as a classic. Did it feel like you had crafted something special at the time?

**Ian: **Hahaha not at all , i was just happy that i had finally finished that album . Took me a year.

**RR: **You've had a career spanning almost 3 decades, but if we asked you to pick one set that stands out in your memory, which would it be?

**Ian:** People asked me that a lot and i have to say that i definitely cannot pick one favourite set . Far too many amazing experiences all over the world !

**RR: **Are there any new artists that you are digging at the moment and would recommend?

**Ian:** Trikk , Black Loops , Dan Beaumont , Mathias Schober , Wajeed

**RR:** We really like your photography blog, Weekend views, in which you take pictures from the view of your hotel room. What gave you the idea? ...Can we expect a photo from your Sydney visit??

**Ian**: Ohhhhh i need to update that ! I started it in the 90’s with a classic film camera , can’t remember how i got the idea . Then i forgot it for a while and now i’m back onto it .

**RR: **Finally - what else do you have in the pipeline this year?

**Ian: **A new Album !!!!
