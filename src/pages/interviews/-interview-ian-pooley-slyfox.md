_After wowing the crowd last month in Sydney, _[_Rave Reviewz_](https://magazine.ravereviewz.net)_ caught up with DJ and production wizard, Ian Pooley for a quick chat and debrief on the Australia trip. _

**RR: Hey Ian! You were in Sydney last month and played at [SLYFOX](https://www.facebook.com/slyfoxenmore/) and [S.A.S.H](https://www.facebook.com/sashsundays/) - two very different settings. How did you find them?**

Ian: I’ve played SASH a few times. SASH by day is a lot of fun - really energetic and fun crowd. This time it started raining heavily in the middle of my set. It was crazy ! We had to move the booth , set up umbrellas and wipe the CDJs all while I was playing. The crowd was phenomenal, they went crazy hahaha! I played SLYFOX for the first time and it was very nice. The venue is more intimate and you are really close to the crowd - I like that. The sound system is great too! 
<br><br>

**RR: Good stuff! The last time you were in Australia was 2 years ago. How was the experience? **

Ian: Very nice. I played [Something Else](https://ravereviewz.net.au/interview/alex-dimitr%C3%B6ff-something-else) at Burdekin first and the SASH by day and by night. Really cool!
<br><br>

**RR: You run 2 successful labels, [Pooledmusic](https://www.facebook.com/Pooledmusic) and Montage - focusing on house and techno, respectively. What are the challenges you face in managing the two?**

Ian: I’d say finding new talent , people who haven’t released much previously and who relate to my own sound. [Indira Paganotto](https://www.facebook.com/IndiraPaganotto/) is a perfect example for that. Her tracks always sound that they could’ve been produced by me.
<br><br>

**RR: You also have some serious kit in your studio - can you tell us about your most prized piece of equipment? **

Ian: The Akai MPC 3000 is the heart of my studio, it controls all my synthesizers and drum machines and I use it in every track.

**RR: You’ve released many tracks and remixes over the years - do you have a personal favourite?**

Ian: Not really! Too many to mention and with a lot of them I have special memories.
<br><br>

**RR: Your 1998 Meridian album is well-recognised as a classic. Did it feel like you had crafted something special at the time?**

Ian: Haha not at all. I was just happy that I had finally finished that album. Took me a year.

**RR: You've had a career spanning almost 3 decades, but if we asked you to pick one set that stands out in your memory, which would it be?**

Ian: People ask me that a lot and I have to say that I definitely cannot pick one favourite set. Far too many amazing experiences all over the world!
<br><br>

**RR: Fair enough. Are there any new artists that you are digging at the moment and would recommend?**

Ian: [Trikk](https://www.facebook.com/musictrikk/), [Black Loops](https://www.facebook.com/blackloopsitaly/), [Dan Beaumont](https://www.facebook.com/danbeaumont.london/), [Mathias Schober](https://www.facebook.com/mathiasschober.showb/) & [Wajeed](https://www.facebook.com/waajeedmusic/).
<br><br>

**RR: We really like your photography blog, [Weekend views](http://weekendviews.tumblr.com/), in which you take pictures from the view of your hotel room. What gave you the idea? ...Can we expect a photo from your Sydney visit??**

Ian: Ohhh I need to update that! I started it in the 90s with a classic film camera, can’t remember how i got the idea. Then i forgot it for a while and now i’m back onto it.
<br><br>

**RR: Finally - what else do you have in the pipeline this year?**

Ian: A new album!
<br><br>

**RR: We'll let you get back in the studio. Thanks for the chat!**
