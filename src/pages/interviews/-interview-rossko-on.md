**Rossko, good to chat. You’re lined up to play at SLYFOX and S.A.S.H next week. What do you have planned for us with the two sets? **

Rossko: Yes it’s my 3rd time back to Australia, the response has been great. I’ll be playing the sunrise set in the Glass terrace at S.A.S.H. It’s Queens day, so they are open 24hours. I’ve played in that room twice, once by myself and a crazy b2b2b with Enzo & Seb all night long, the vibe can get electric in there. I always try to connect with the people on the day but for sure it will be full of energy on a slick techno tip and when the sun comes up I’ll keep it more grooving, more housey and of course a little bit tripper for that after party vibe.

It will be my 1st time at Slyfox but I heard it's dark & sweaty so I’ll bring some of that London & Berlin spirit with me. Some heads down hands up moments.

**You've played at SASH many times, and you're part of the original FUSE crew - which is another legendary Sunday day party. What do you think it is that makes Sunday raving so popular?**

Rossko:** **I found in London Sundays were much more cosmopolitan, more relaxed, more vibes, even the characters you met are more wild. I guess every major city is the same. The attitude to the party is different, you can feel it from the promoter, to the DJ, to the music, even the dance floor atmosphere. I have always noticed small communities are always born, you go see like minded friends week in week out who are really into the music just like you, I guess sharing the same passion and being updated with the new music keeps the spirit alive. I've seen it at Fuse many times over the last 10 years, communities come and go like a revolving door, it's like a birthplace where people become inspired and go off and start their own party, become a DJ etc. 

Some of my best friends I have met on the dance floor, in fact it's where I met all the Fuse crew before we got together, in many Sunday after parties in London like Public Life and T-Bar for example. Long live Sundays.

**How would you describe the journey from those early days of FUSE up until the present day where the brand and label are globally recognised? And what are the most important lessons you've learnt along the way?**

Rossko: It's been an amazing one. Hard to put in words really. I’ve learnt so much along the way. Not just about music but about myself and life. The more I understand life the more I understand music - I guess it's kind of encoded in there somewhere. Enzo has been incredible with all of us and it’s his vision and guidance that brings us to where we are today. We were just a bunch of clubbers from the dance floor who loved their music and follow their passion. 

Musically I’ve learned so much to play what you feel, don’t think too much and stop to watch what everyone else is doing. Of course be inspired but be as original as possible - it’s your personality that defines your music and everyone is unique in there own way. When the fun stops. Stop!

**You're also heavily involved with the A&R of the INFUSE label. Can you tell us what you look for when scouting out new talent?**

Rossko: A lot of Infuse artists have come from connecting at the gigs we've played together prior to music being sent - OdD, Fabe & Ferro for example. We connected on a level, earned the respect from each other and then the music followed. Everyone has their own individual sound and more importantly understands the ethos at Fuse. It’s more than just a label. The music is road tested by the residents - if we play them and it’s moving the crowd then we know these are the types of records other people will want to buy. There will always be one ‘play dem’ track where you can’t help but fit them in all your sets - there that good! For me I look out for personality, groove & understanding of the dance floor inside the track. There are so many different styles on the label but I think that is what connects them all.

**Since the lockout laws were introduced in 2014, Sydney has seen an increase in warehouse parties. As these were your forte during the 'Cerca Trova' warehouse party days, what advice would you give to anyone organising a secret rave? **

Rossko: Safety 1st is ultimate. Know the law's and the problems you may encounter. Nothing should be a surprise. It's your responsibility, you have to take what you do seriously. Invest in a good sound system, sound treatment and sound engineer, these make good parties great. I've seen many potentially amazing parties fall so short because the promoter cut corners with these things. Also, employ a toilet cleaning attendant - Vital!

**We've got to ask you about that b2b2b set with Archie Hamilton and Enzo Siragusa earlier this year at Mint Club. How much preparation went into that set? Was it a challenge or did the three of you work together comfortably?**

Rossko: None. We all just prepare as we would do normally for every set. I don't think we even discussed the set until after we finished playing. I think that is the best way for any b2b. Mint Club is like our 2nd home, when you have an amazing sound system, DJ booth, promoter and a wicked crowd in your hand, I think its harder to miss the point. DJ wise, its a 6th sense that comes when you think less and feel more with us, the b2b2b went so quick and flowed seamlessly. Happily, we have been invited do it again, this time at Cocoon In The Park in Leeds, Sven Vath's festival.

**We've been enjoying the latest Arkityp release, '3 For A Tenner'. We gather that Arkityp started out as a party series in Ibiza, what led to you transforming the project into a record label?**

After a few years of playing together and becoming super close as friends, we kind of knew each other inside out, so our b2b's started to really make sense. It was the next logical progression to see if we can do the same in the studio. Both EPs consisted of 3 days for 3 tracks, it just oozed out of us effortlessly. Now we can look back and say we left our own mark there, like mini time capsules with all our memories locked inside. We really do have fun making music together, we just wished we could spend more time in the studio.

DJing has taken you all over the world - is there a particular gig that stands out in your memories?
Thats a tough one. My Cerca Trova parties were pretty legendary. Once we had a power cut for like 20mins - we thought the party was going to stop - no one left just incase - then someone finally fixed the fuse next door - there was that boom from the mixer switching on through speakers. I instantly picked up the needle off the record that was playing before the power cut, dropped it back down and its just rolled perfectly from a break down into the drop. The place went nuts. Synergy!

Playing the Cave Rave parties in Ibiza for Bushwacka's Full Moon parties were insane, especially that moment as the sun was rising but also in the cave watching the moon set around 6am. Truly upside down inside out moments.
More recently closing Amnesia b2b with Archie, I would say it has to be my proudest moment. For all the hard work we have put in individually and collectively it was truly amazing.
<br><br> 

**And what else have you got locked in for the rest of year? Any big plans?**

I have my head down in my studio in Berlin, a lot of unreleased tracks made & a lot of new music being released this year including a remix for Djebali on his Reworks label with Audio Werner, a remix for Moss Co. (Archie's label), my 1st Fuse solo EP & I've just set up my own label called 'Late Night Skanking' which will drop 2019. 

**Last question - we heard you were a grime MC back in the day. What are your thoughts on the genre's direction in recent years? And who is your favourite grime artist??**

D double E without a doubt. I still sample his lyrics and layer them in my sets today. I always get a few people write me and ask did I drop his lyric over the top - it's such a nice feeling when you can reach out to just a few that know about this music, it keeps me alive or should I say young.

To be honest I left that music a long time ago, I was raving at FWD at Plastic People and the early DMZ parties when the real deeper dubstep jus started. For me I heavily connect with all early grime music. I really was part of that movement. It was the 1st time we were all listening to it, nobody knew what the next record would be or sound like. Everything was new & fresh. It was so exciting to go record shops like Rhythm Division in Bow, London on a weekly basis and listen to new white labels. It was fierce back then.  

Check the D Double E & DJ TUBBY set on youtube. This for me defines grime. It's almost half a lifetime ago and still timeless today. I'm not really feeling Grime at the moment, as the beats back then were written to MC on, now I feel these guys have moved onto making music for Radio play, so the vibe and idea has changed but I will always dip in and check what's going on.
