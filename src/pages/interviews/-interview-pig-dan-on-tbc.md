**RR: Welcome back to **[**Sydney**](https://www.ravereviewz.net/Events-Location/Sydney)**! Did you cope OK with the long ass flight over to Australia?**

Pig&Dan: After all these years on the road, one thing we are definitely accustomed to is flying. We now look at it as our studio time during the day, or when we have a night flight – a rest place. When you spend more than 1,000 hours in the air every year, you really learn how to use that time wisely and we have written some of our biggest tracks from 11,000 meters!
<br><br>

**RR: Now we heard you actually met each other on a plane. Talk us through that encounter and how it set you both on this path.**

Pig&Dan: Whilst on that fight to Mallorca I was talking to the person beside me about the fact that I was a resident DJ at Ministry of Sound and was touring globally as a Drum&Bass artist at the time. The person behind me (Igor) leant forwards and stated that they were also working in music and was a DJ. When going to the bus to the Terminal from the plane we decided to swap numbers. Because of my situation with my mother’s health and dealing with her passing away at the time, I never thought to call that number. Two years down the line a friend of mine said I should I meet a guy called Pig because he’s also producing music, I of course chuckled and said “OK, sure”. I went over and met this guy, and we got on really well however didn’t realise that we had met two years previously on the plane. When it hit home to us both that we had been on that plane together, we knew this was fate and we have to try working together. When we did there was a very strange yet powerful synergy between us and with his Balearic house and my dnb mix it seemed to gel in a special way.
<br><br>

**RR: You’ve been working together for a while now. How has the dynamic changed over the years? And does it differ in the studio and behind the decks?**

Pig&Dan: We’ve gained the ability to do things alone, but with the knowledge of what the other one would think of it. I honestly know when producing alone what Igor’s thoughts would be. It’s like he’s sitting beside me which is kind of freaky. It's a slightly different dynamic behind the decks because we surprise and challenge each other in a very positive way - most of the time. Playing mostly our own music means we know where we are going however sometimes one of us plays a track that the I think thinks is really a change in musical direction. It’s really fun to have this flow when playing together however it’s no easy thing unless you have our synergy.
<br><br>

**RR: Can you describe the highlights and challenges of managing your label ELEVATE over the past 5 years? What do you think has been the key to its success?**

Pig&Dan: This is actually our 6th label we have started together, and after all of those we have pretty much now learned all the dos and don’ts. Now with Scott, our label manager, in charge of running the day-to-day it goes all incredibly smooth! We take care of the creative side of things, and Scott who also runs Bedrock, Mood and a few other big labels, is the master of making it all happen.
<br><br>

**RR: Your latest EP 'Give' marks a milestone 100th release on the label. How did the collaboration with Mark Reeves come about? And what was the concept behind the track?**

Pig&Dan: Mark and us go way back and have collaborated before on other labels as well as Elevate. The single is all about having a good time, generating those smiley faces and a hands in the air moment on the dancefloor. Both tracks are really pumping yet euphoric records that are all about elevating the crowd, hence the label's name.
<br><br>

**RR: Speaking of collaborations, we want to ask you about the final space Ibiza compilation CD you did with **[**Carl Cox**](https://magazine.ravereviewz.net/interview/carl-cox-pure)** & Mark Brown. What was it like working with Carl? And what was the creative process you went through?**

Pig&Dan: It was an honour of course to be asked to represent the very last Space CD alongside Carl and Mark. This was a historic club and played a major role in our life as ravers and DJs for so many years. Creatively speaking it was left to us to come up with the goods which was no easy task under that pressure to deliver our best.

**RR: Ok, looking back what do you both wish you knew when starting out in the music industry?**

Pig&Dan: You could say we wish we knew how much we would be ripped off and how hard it is, but that would have dulled our determination I think. This business is full of sharks, however the positives outweigh the negatives in the end. It’s a long road and you’re never really ready for that. There’s no elevator to success, just the stairs as they say.

This industry involves devotion of the highest level, you need to get through it day for day and the results are incredibly rewarding. Giving people time out from their everyday troubles and helping a crowd unite without thoughts of religion or language or origins is the biggest honour of all. Smiling people all dancing together in a positive environment is a priceless experience.
<br><br> 

**RR: And if you had to pick one gig that really stands out in your memory over the years, what would it be?**

Pig&Dan: Probably the first time we played at Cocoon in Amnesia Ibiza. A club I used to go to at a young age a stare up at the DJ booth dreaming of being there one day. When that day came I shook from nerves so much I found it hard to control the pitch on the decks.
<br><br>

**RR: Now, in the past, the two of you have compared DJing to a "sexual experience" haha. Can you elaborate on this for us??**

Pig&Dan: Easily, a DJ set should have some foreplay. If you just bang it out there’s nowhere to go, it’s just a bang and over. We feel a whole event should be a crescendo, warm up DJs should slowly excite the crowd and so on. It’s a build-up, so people of the energy to orgasm at the correct moments.
<br><br>

**RR: Finally, if we asked you to describe each other in 3 words, what would you say?**

Dan to Pig: Chaotic, impulsive, unique

Pig to Dan: Sensitive, raving, professor
