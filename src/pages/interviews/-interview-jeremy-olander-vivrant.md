Recognised for his technical artistry and endearing releases, J[eremy Olander](https://www.facebook.com/jeremyolander/) is a pre-eminent force on the progressive house stage. We talk to the [Vivrant](https://www.facebook.com/vivrantmusic/) label boss, as he prepares for his performance at [Electric Gardens Festival](https://www.facebook.com/electricgardensfestival/).

**RR:** Jeremy, great to chat to you! We're super excited that you'll be joining us for Electric Gardens festival. You've played the festival before – how was the experience last time?

**Jeremy:** Good to talk to you as well! Last time I was here was two years ago I think, and it was nothing but great. Such an awesome lineup this year as well. Very humbling to be a part of. Really looking forward to closing the [Rio](https://www.facebook.com/ReturnToRio/) stage!

**RR:** And what can we expect from your set this time?

**Jeremy:** I always try out more new tracks when I play for crowds that I feel are more educated, so definitely expect that. I try to feel out the vibe and then decide what to play... can't plan much more than that.

**RR:** You're sharing the Electric Gardens line up with lots of great artists. Is there anyone you're looking forward to seeing play?

**Jeremy:** It’s always good to see [Henry Saiz](https://www.facebook.com/HenrySaizOfficial/) play, and hopefully he will play some new stuff from his album. We were very fortunate to have him over for one of our Vivrant shows two years ago when he did a remix for me. Also really looking forward to hearing [Petar Dundov](https://www.facebook.com/dundov/) play - always been a big fan but I’ve never had the chance to catch him.

**RR:** What else do you have planned for your visit to Australia?

**Jeremy:** This time it’ll just be a quick visit. I get in Friday and leave on Sunday. I will try to eat some good food, enjoy the weather since it’s freezing cold back home right now haha.

**RR:** You’ll have to make the most of the Australian summer! Now, your recent debut on [Anjunadeep](https://www.facebook.com/anjunadeep), 'Crossed' is on heavy rotation at Rave Reviewz HQ. How did the collaboration come together?

**Jeremy:** Glad you like it! I’ve been a fan of what they’ve been putting out in recent years. I think they’ve established themselves as a very interesting label with a good mix between deep house and old school progressive, so it’s definitely a fit with some of the stuff I do that’s more on the melodic tip. [Crossed](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Ftrack%2Fcrossed-original-mix%2F9949116&h=ATMgQ09FiY6LOv0mY2x4xP4IMVL0JeqImzBov6Qw8LkVEFRiTOLc-NcxCAgj53aB1wmP6EKf9audBt4jVCqhfRd4-14qTlLB_YtYRraQLvsjAZdUG5WRl8uv) has this smooth melody that builds very nicely, and [Araoz](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Ftrack%2Faraoz-original-mix%2F9949117&h=ATOzevb6Co7IJMcN4U0JOevz_hE9xGGh97pmNbFg3fbq3IWdZ47ACuZEnVQwlTNnzSJ_gNKs3Rk8JoE8n1mwQrAAfHeUuU-J9BXWbyM-yzlwq4wc-sqEQVjX) is a bit more energetic, and it felt really good to finally debut on a label like Anjuna.

**RR:** You also operate under the techno moniker of Dhillon. Can you tell us the story behind it and how the creative process varies from producing progressive house?

**Jeremy:** It’s not so different really. The creative process is usually that I get inspired from something, which can really be anything, or get an idea stuck in my head and then just try to execute it. I try not to get stuck in genres, I never intended to do progressive house or techno in the beginning, it just happens to come naturally.

**RR:** Congratulations on [Gattaca](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Frelease%2Fgattaca-ep%2F2125181&h=ATNWjvRsa_HfZhLbS6T8HIrZlwsPDfFtdW8tJLZdFMXIaMlbl4PenuMc0LzLTvDMe0d0g7j2ejhJo2VGJlBIgMJ7HLkld1Aqhvsqkwq_3RHTrftD9P0bCATj), the 10th release for your label Vivrant. Can we look forward to any more releases coming up?

**Jeremy:** Thank you very much! Of course. We just had [André Hommen](https://www.facebook.com/andrehommen)’s amazing EP [Abakus](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Frelease%2Fabakus-ep%2F2172666&h=ATMVrUTIJkXDprdfbuc8WregkKClj2EdZ_P1i-Ax08UtleB-RCxzczeuY1lDMpLAUIy5h7Tamtd3CHnqKcZnYV4ZBrHnGXBy1mqSvo4h4DVa_PCXofklGxkJ) in December. First thing in 2018 is a remix EP with [Marino Canal](https://www.facebook.com/MarinoCanal/), [Ejeca](https://www.facebook.com/Ejeca/) and [King Unique](https://www.facebook.com/KingUnique/). [Khen](https://www.facebook.com/khenmusicofficial/) is working on a follow-up EP and I’m working on my next EP too. Then we also have our fifth Vivrant show in Stockholm in February, so a lot of stuff going on.

**RR: **A lot to look forward to! OK... of all the tracks you've made, which is your favourite?

**Jeremy:** Impossible to pick one! They all have a special place for me and usually represent what I was feeling and going through at a certain time of my life. One that I really enjoy playing out at the moment is [Galheera](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Ftrack%2Fgalheera-original-mix%2F9804084&h=ATMyzTvgd7oEspKm-xk2uJTFWGLRr_Ua4DXX-9HGoile9M6sPfadpm7u8LStGrTD4QtIfA4m9GRVkGKFerW8K8BAax8jYEWRTKcStzcVVofKEPwd8bsi57n4) though.

**RR:** And of all the sets you've played, can you pick one for us that really stands out in your memory?

**Jeremy:** Good question! Some of them like the 8 hour set I did at our Vivrant Open Air in Stockholm certainly stands out, it was of course special to play at the Madison Square Garden with [Eric](https://www.facebook.com/EricPrydzOfficial/) a couple of years ago. If I have to pick a recent one, Salon Amador in Medellin, Colombia was really great. Played a festival called Baum there this summer and was fortunate to be able to go back for a club show in December on a Thursday. Sold out and very up for it crowd.

**RR:** We've seen some striking photographs on your Instagram account – you have a particular eye for architecture. Does that influence your music at all?

**Jeremy:** Thank you! Yeah I’ve been really into photography lately, its great whenever I have the time in between shows and traveling to get out and explore a city through a camera. I get inspired by a lot of stuff and architecture is definitely one of them. I’m very lucky to be able to travel the world and see new things.

**RR:** Finally... we hear you love films, especially Korean gangster flicks. Our favourite is ‘A Bittersweet Life’. What's yours??

**Jeremy:** Good choice! Loved that one. I think my favourite is ‘Operation New World’ - lost count of how many times I’ve seen it.

**RR:** Great film! See you in a few weeks!
