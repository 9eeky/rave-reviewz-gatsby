**RR:** Great to chat Kiko – we’re looking forward to your performance this weekend. What kind of set can we expect from you?

**Kiko:** Hi! I am going to play a lot of my own productions and try out some new tracks of mine.

**RR: **Sounds good! Now you've played in Australia a few times - how were those experiences?

**Kiko:** It's been about 5 or 6 times that I’ve played in Australia. I played at the Babylon Festival last year. I was with my old friend [The Hacker](https://www.facebook.com/DJTheHacker/)! I love playing in Australia, people are very receptive to the music I play. My true first time in Australia was in Sydney and Melbourne in 2002 or 2003.

**RR:** You ran a very popular record store in the 90s. What was the dance scene like back then in Grenoble? 

**Kiko:** I opened the record store in 1994, and thanks to this shop, I met The Hacker, [Miss Kittin](https://www.facebook.com/misskittin/) and [Oxia](https://www.facebook.com/OXIA.official/), who are all from Grenoble. It’s with Oxia that we set up our first record label Ozone in 1995. Later we created the goodlife label in 1997 with The Hacker. 

**RR:** You've dabbled in multiple genres from new wave to techno and electro to italo disco. What made you experiment with so many different styles?

**Kiko:** Yes in Grenoble we love italo disco, because Grenoble is not very far from Italy. My reference group is of course on [Depeche Mode](https://www.facebook.com/depechemode/). My tracks are full of these influences.

**RR: **We gather that you have produced over 500 tracks! How do you keep finding fresh ideas for music?

**Kiko:** Music is like a therapy for me, I work every day in my Bunker aka studio - I’ve been doing that for 24 years now! I need to create, it's vital for me.

**RR:** You have a track with [Thomas Gandey](https://www.facebook.com/ThomasGandeyOfficial/) due out next month. Can you tell us a bit about the collaboration?

**Kiko:** I met Thomas Gandey via facebook and he had already produced tracks with my friend [Oliver Giacomotto](https://www.facebook.com/oliviergiacomotto/), who I've known for quite a few years! I love his voice! We had a track which was released in February on Suara Records and we have another track that will be released on the 20th of April for [Stil Vor Talent](https://www.facebook.com/stilvortalent/).

**RR: **You also have a side project called 'Minota' which is signed under [Miguel Campbell](https://www.facebook.com/miguelcampbellofficial/)'s label. How did that come together?

**Kiko: **. I know Miguel Campbell very well, he's like family to me and I love his label Outcross Records. This is actually not my first side project - I was already doing house music 20 years ago with Oxia, under the name of [Phunky Data](https://www.facebook.com/phunkydatamusic)

**RR: **Having worked in the music business for many years, what would you say has been the key to your longevity? 

**Kiko: **To work and and to never give up! And of course, be well surrounded by trustworthy people. 

**RR:** And across your extensive career, which gig has been the most memorable for you?

**Kiko:** In 2011 and 2012, I toured with Carl Cox for 2 years, it was such an epic experience.

**RR: **Finally - what else have you got coming up this year?

**Kiko: **This year I am going to focus a lot on production haha!

**RR: ** Thanks for chatting Kiko!

**Kiko: **Thanks for having me.
