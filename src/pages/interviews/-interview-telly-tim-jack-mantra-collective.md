**RR: **Hey Telly, Tim and Jack! David Gtronic will be joining you and the team for the launch of Mantra Collective Records on Saturday. What can we all expect from the night?

**Mantra Collective: **Well it’s shaping up to be quite massive… We have a fully stacked local lineup including Mantra Collective’s aboutjack, Telly and Whitecat, Mike Watts, Venda and Charles supporting an underground weapon David Gtronic at Civic Underground - without a doubt the venue with Sydney’s best sound system. It will be a celebratory affair no doubt with the launch of our label that will no doubt be a real highlight this long weekend.

**RR:** Can you tell us how the idea to start the label come about and what the ethos will be?

**Mantra Collective:** We have been expressing ourselves artistically by throwing boutique events and DJing for over 5 years and have had the immense pleasure of hosting the very best of local and international talent at our parties. Music of course has been front and centre and a burning desire to contribute our sound around the world has driven us to seek out artists from both Australia but also abroad to release on Mantra Collective Records which will be vinyl only and strictly limited press.
As passionate vinyl collectors, we recognise that art can also help tell a story in addition to the tracks on a release so we have recruited Cote, one of Romania’s most respected visual artists who 3D maps insane venues and festivals with moving beautiful textures and stunning imagery. With Cote blowing minds at Sunwaves Festival annually and our own Mantra Collective x SASH Vivid Music showcase at Arthouse a few years back, it is a great honour to have him as our artistic mastermind for our upcoming releases in collaboration with Tyson Bruun.

**RR: **Mantra Collective have achieved a lot over the years - how did you first get together?

**Mantra Collective:**  We were brought together by mutual friends and a strong unwavering passion for music. With a desire to bring something unique to the table, we decided to kick things off with a boat party at the height of summer in 2012 and have never looked back.
Since then, Mantra Collective have had a whole range of underground talent headline their parties including a label showcase from Fuse (Enzo Siragusa, Seb Zito & Rich NxT) and individual acts such as East End Dubs, Barac, Subb-an, Cezar, Cosmjn & Lizz, Bill Patrick, Masomenos, DJ W!LD, Andrey Pushkarev, Dana Ruh, Molly, Arapu, Cote (VJ) Diego Krause, Cesare VS Disorder, John Dimas and Varhat to name a few...

**RR:** What is the origin of the name Mantra Collective and how would you describe your sound?

**Mantra Collective:** For us to come up with the name Mantra Collective, it took weeks of brainstorming and many heated meetings to finally rest on the name. We particularly loved bringing two words that are significant to the 3 of us including “Mantra” which means (originally in Hinduism and Buddhism) a word or sound repeated to aid concentration in meditation and “Collective” which means done or shared by all members of a group of people; involving a whole group or society. So in a way the name “Mantra Collective” has come to represent a shared consciousness that we strive to achieve through music and experiences at our events.

**RR: **Of the many Mantra parties you’ve hosted, which one stands out in your memories?

**Mantra Collective: **Bare Essentials & Mantra Collective Presents Reconstructed with Barac and East End Dubs (February 2017) stands out to me as the crown jewel in our history of throwing events. Perhaps our most ambitious and creative project, we threw a proper 900 person rave in a carpark with 2 of the worlds leading underground acts. Not only was it ambitious in terms of location and lineup, but we had enlisted the very best Sydney had to offer in terms of FunktionOne Sound and world class lighting system that is still talked about to this day. An unexpected heatwave meant we had to use our combined industry experience to pull together a powerful impromptu cooling system to keep the crowd cool and happy…

**RR: **You guys have played in Japan a couple of times - how were those experiences?

**Mantra Collective:** Japan was and continues to be one of the most amazing places to tour and visit. Nothing screams passion, respect, precision and integrity like Japanese culture and this is reflected in every facet of their society. This might sound crazy but every experience from convenience store egg sandwiches to record shopping to clubbing is bathed in so much care and love, you can sense the genuine obsession with quality and attention to detail.

**RR: **Your Black Gold, all vinyl affairs, have been a big hit. What do you like about playing and curating vinyl sets?

**Mantra Collective: **There is something very special about playing vinyl… Firstly, in a world of disposable and readily available digital music, a homogony has permeated the music scene for quite some time. This is particularly prevalent in more commercial sounds and something we are not really drawn to. Many records tend to be “vinyl only” which means that no two collections will be the same and many DJs out and about are able to express themselves creatively with records not discovered or played by others. In addition, I think that the vinyl culture of collecting, collaborating and the challenge of mixing physical records is absolutely intoxicating. Once you get started it is truly is addictive and becomes a very expensive habit.

**RR:** Now it will be the 6th birthday of Mantra Collective in November. If you could bring in any DJ as a special guest, who would it to be?

**Mantra Collective:** I think when we blow out the candles for the 6th time, it will have to be someone special but can’t away any clues… Our wishlist is top secret!

**RR: **Finally - what’s in the pipeline for you and Mantra Collective?

**Mantra Collective:** We have massive exciting plans in the pipeline coming up! Another 3 EPs on Mantra Collective Records are in the works and a string of our infamous warehouse parties being pieced together as we speak. In addition, we have a number of huge internationals that will be gracing our shores and a new and exciting collaboration with Bare Essentials is about to be announced.
We have just made public our new Mantra Collective Resident DJ and have one more to announce.
Watch this space ;)
