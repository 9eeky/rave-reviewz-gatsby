**RR: Vivie Ann, welcome to Sydney. Let’s start by talking about your eagerly anticipated performance at Return to Rio. Can you tell us what you have in store for us?**

Haha we get this question a lot, and we love to say the same answer - what do we have in store for you? You gotta come see to find out, cause we don’t even know — basically as soon as we have a second with the vibe of the crowd, we pick a direction!  Love that spontaneous process, but always left with a smile on all our faces, and feeling a bit more closely connected. Maybe a little group hug at the end?
<br><br>

**RR: You’re also a speaker at the EMC Conference in Sydney. In broad terms, what will you be discussing?**

On these panels it can always go in a few directions depending on how many people are on them, but I have been very passionate about reducing single use plastics in our scene, and would love to go more in depth on the master plan I’ve been building for this through the BYE BYE PLASTIC initiative, for DJs, venues, and promoters. Basically what I noticed from many conversations with DJs and colleagues in our scene, is that we all want change, but nobody has time to do it. So after 10000 conversations on it at dinners and after parties, I decided to take the baton and go deep on it.  In a nutshell, I’ve put a little team together and have been doing all the research starting in territories like UK, SPAIN, USA, and MEXICO and finding solutions to single use plastics namely straws, water bottles and cups (to start). During the booking process of a DJ, they (or the agent) can open up a conversation like ‘hey, before we confirm we just wanted to talk about what’s really important to us at the moment and that’s reducing single use plastics — and what’s your thoughts on the topic?’ And open the conversation that way — it will come with an info sheet, and if the promoter / venue would like to work on solutions, then they can call the BYE BYE PLASTIC Hotline, and there will be a team of people to help come up with a solution unique to your venue, cause there is no one size fits all solution for moving to sustainable practices. Let me tell you, it’s another rabbit hole! But super exciting, because everyone is super eager for change!

**RR: We’ve heard your sound described as ‘shamanic house’ (and perhaps jokingly by Anstascia, as ‘vegan techno’ haha). Spirituality does seem to be an integral part of your world view. What does it mean to you and what relationship does it have to your music?**

Ha. This Spiritual world is such an infinite topic, but sometimes used in a really sarcastic or somewhat judging way by people who haven’t opened up to the concept yet.  The fact is we are all spiritual beings, we are all just a bundle of energy, just somehow through evolution, technology, and the monkey mind we’ve lost that connection, but through the wellness revolution, it’s coming back in some way shape or form. When I got in touch with my inner self (we can call this the spiritual part), and started exploring breath work, and different meditations, tantra, yoga, kundalini and more… working with some plant medicines like peyote and ayahuasca and mushrooms, you start to have a deeper connection with nature/the earth, and through these you can set intentions and start asking questions. Through this exploration I’ve discovered sound meditations, and the power of gongs, and different instruments from the east that have many more keys than the typical 12 note scale we know of, and how certain frequencies tap into different moods, feelings, and emotions — even can be called healing frequencies.  All that stuff has peeled off layers on the infinite depth of the concept of sound frequencies and music.   So to integrate some of these concepts into the productions is bringing me down an interesting path that I want to keep discovering.  Sometimes it’s so low that its subliminal, but it’s all about the feeling.

**RR: Congratulations on the development of the ABRACADABRA event brand into an imprint. How has the new venture been going? Any challenges so far?**

The new venture has been such an incredible learning process, and like a playground, because we have been able to incorporate all the different interests and ideas we’ve been gathering over the years, on how we can go deeper with music also connect on a deeper level with our community while being kids in a candy store and constantly being curious. Being able to incorporate all that goodness at our ABRA parties, and then see what comes of it, is the greatest feeling. In terms of challenges, I don’t think there is a specific challenge but many venues and promoters want to lump ABRA into a branded party. But it's much more than that and more tailored than bringing some signage and some decor and DJs. There’s a lot more going on in the details that is super subtle - it's what you remember when you leave after the party. So we have to explain this to a lot of promoters, and basically tell them it’s not for clubs... it’s really for unique venues where we can create a curated playground for our community. 

**RR: The inaugural release, ‘Circus’ has been well received. What was the inspiration behind the track? Talk us through its development.**

We really just wanted to make a track that was fun, and you felt like you were in a circus in the summer.  We had this let’s get in the circus vibes for the summer last year. And that’s what happened!!! We found a Serbian folk type track and sampled it a bunch of different ways, and out came the circus!

**RR: We know you had your own stage at Tomorrowland this year. How was that given that the music on offer is predominantly EDM?**

Of course we also asked ourselves these question before confirming! We have a good friend who is close knit on the Tomorrowland team and he frequents Tulum and is a green warrior — so we had lots of conversations about it and we all decided the timing might be right to plant some seeds with the masses! We still have a lot of work to do but the experience was incredible, and the production there is just wow! I think we have a lot to learn from each other! One thing I can say though is that Tomorrowland being the biggest and one of the most influential festivals in the world could take a much larger initiative in sustainability! If you’re reading this Tomorrowland or any other festival venue promoter or artist or brand, and you have some questions on how to start, get in touch with me - we all have to take some steps together.

**RR: We know you are strong advocates for protecting the world’s oceans from plastic, which we applaud you for. We recently held a campaign and event to raised money for mental health charities, which is an important cause for us. Apart from fundraising activities, how do you think music can be a force for positive change in the world?**

DJs can use their voice to bring together their community on topics close to their hearts. As BLOND:ISH we implement the Bye Bye Plastic project with almost every gig and with these little step-by-step changes, change the single use plastic hurdle. By paying more attention to this naturally we will change our behaviors as consumers and our consumption can be minimized over time, it’s a domino effect. I put special frequencies in our music without telling people to give a positive vibe! Whether it’s creativity or love or compassion.



**RR: And finally what’s up next for Blond:ish? And looking to the future, what would you most like to achieve in your careers?**

We’re always excited for our first show of new year, which is ABRACADABRA. It’s on Jan 3.2019 in Tulum, Mexico on the beach of course! As cliché as it seems I wanna take this DJ and music community to the next level and change the world!! The layers that sound has are endless! It’s even outside the scope of our understanding because of our limited senses, it’s everywhere!
