**RR: **Hi Carl - I’m Kamran Ahmed from Rave Reviewz. So good to to talk to you, thanks for taking the time. We’re all really looking forward to [PURE](https://www.facebook.com/purecarlcox/) here in Sydney - you have a great line up this year, how do you think it’ll be different to last year? 

**Carl:** Well first and foremost we’ve changed around the production once again. People really enjoy that we try and keep the production as minimal as possible, but also in line with what they expect to see today. Of course, the sound is always paramount for us - the DJs we have this year will create a completely different sound, but it will obviously still be the sound of house & techno music. We have [Paco Osuna](https://www.facebook.com/PacoOsunaOfficial/) and [Nastia](https://www.facebook.com/Nastia.official/), which for me is really exciting – two people with that European sound, who I think are the best at it. I’m sure me and Eric Powell will be able to support them in their quest to play the very best music possible. 

**RR: **You’ve also got [Fabio Neural](https://www.facebook.com/fabioneural/) on the line up, we had a chat with him and he said you’ve been a big influence in his career. Do you enjoy that side of the business, nurturing young talent?

**Carl: **Yeah - I’ve always been a guy who acknowledges the fact that no one man is an island. I can’t do everything but I can support what I believe people should listen to or at least be aware of. It would be difficult for Fabio to come over here off his own back, even though he’s made some of the most amazing music of all time - people still don’t know that. So to be able to bring him to the forefront so he can shine is quite exciting for me, and he’s very excited by it too. He’s been waiting for his time and it’s now coming. He’s made so much music, he could play just his own records and still rock the house! I actually want him to do that haha. 

**RR: **He actually told us that when he makes a track he thinks ‘Is this something Carl Cox would play?’…

**Carl: **Yeah, it’s great that he has me in mind, but it’s also important that he makes things that represent himself and that he keeps that integrity as an artist. He’s a great friend as well and down the line we’re looking to do some sort of collaboration, which I think will be quite exciting - he has great ideas and so do I. For us to come together will be very powerful. I really like the idea that I’ve been able to support someone like Fabio and get people to understand that he’s as talented and natural a DJ as anyone I’ve ever seen.  

**RR: **Speaking of collaborations we’re big fans of your track with [Nicole Moudaber](https://www.facebook.com/officialnicolemoudaber/) - See You next Tuesday. Can you tell us how that collaboration came about and the creative process the two of you went through when making it?

**Carl: **Me and Nicole are obviously very tight and have been for many years - I love her, and her music prevails. You can see where she’s ended up, she’s gone onwards and upwards and beyond herself! I think it was natural that we came together to create something. What I had was a 4 second bassline… See you next Tuesday was all created from a 4 second bassline. So she was like ‘where Is the rest of the track’?? And I was like, ‘well actually that’s it'! So she looked at me disgusted, thinking you lazy bastard haha, then she went away and created See You Next Tuesday and came back to me with the track. Then I got back to her with my ideas and we went back and forth with it through Ableton, and eventually agreed on the track and stuck by it.

**RR: **And what about the title of the track, how did you decide on that - [See You Next Tuesday](https://www.beatport.com/track/see-you-next-tuesday-original/9974480)?? 

**Carl: **Well… because all the time I was playing at [Space](https://www.facebook.com/spaceibiza/), it was a Tuesday night. At the end of the night I would always say ‘see you next Tuesday’, so that’s where it came from… but it does have other connotations haha.

**RR:** Haha yeah that’s why I asked… and especially commonly used here in Australia!

**Carl: **Haha well I can’t exactly say it, but apparently it’s used as a term of endearment!

**RR:** Absolutely haha. Any other productions of your own coming out soon?

**Carl:** Basically I’ve built my new studio here in Australia, in Melbourne and I’m really excited to make more new music and to get behind some more new remixes. I’ve just done a remix for [Monkey Safari](https://www.facebook.com/monkeysafari/), the track is called Energy. I’ve done a remix for [Alex Mind](https://www.facebook.com/alexmindmusic/), called Lost. I’ve just put out a new version of Chip E’s Time to Jack, which I’m really proud of… oh and a new remix for Moby, Feel so real.

**RR: **So when you’re producing, where do you find inspiration? A lot of producers, especially when starting out can hit that mental roadblock -  where do you get your ideas?

**Carl: **Good question ha ha! I really don’t know, I have so many ideas in my head that I’ve just got to get them out. That’s the reason I make my music -  whether it works or not, I don’t really care. It’s in there and it has to come out! I’ve just done a track called Dark Alley which has been signed to [Yousef](https://www.facebook.com/yousefcircus/)’s label [Circus](https://www.facebook.com/CircusRecordings/) - this track is a mental squidgy acid bassline track which just slams the floor. Where it came from I have absolutely no idea, but that riff and that sound were just going round and round in my head - so I just had to get it out. And the title Dark Alley was like – ‘if you met this track down a dark alley you’d probably have a big fight with it, and only one of you would win’! It just has that energy and power about it. On the other hand I’ve just finished off this mix for Nine Toes - their old hit, that they had out two years ago and it’s very pretty! So wherever it takes me, wherever my head is, that that’s how the music gets made.

**RR: **Cool. Your label [Intec](https://www.facebook.com/IntecDigital/) has been so influential, we really liked [Darren Emerson](https://www.facebook.com/DarrenEmersonMusic/)’s release on it - [The Bird Cage EP](https://www.beatport.com/release/birdcage-ep/2213277). We know that you two are good mates and when we interviewed him a while back, he told us that the first time he came to Australia, you him and Norman Cook ([Fatboy Slim](https://www.facebook.com/fatboyslim/)) where on a yacht, eating lobster and drinking champagne. Do you remember that??

**Carl: **I remember it very well because it was the first time us three British guys were enjoying Christmas Day on a yacht! It was bizarre for us to be having Christmas dinner on a beautiful day out on Sydney harbour! It was a moment for all of us, because we knew that our friends back in the UK were freezing their nuts off haha. And it was Darren’s first introduction to the Australian crowd, we had a ball… he was still the man from [Underworld](https://www.facebook.com/Underworld/), Norman Cook was Fatboy slim, I was there as Carl Cox.. we came together as a unit to give people the best time possible and it was great. 

Darren has actually made an abundance of amazing new music and this is our second release with him. We want to put out another EP from him this year, we’re going to cherry pick what’s on it. I think he has that old school feel to his sound and he makes it with a lot of heart. In Birdcage you can really feel the passion and the energy that he’s created it with, it’s not techno by numbers at all. I really love that - he is one of my most revered, prolific producers. I’m looking to bring him over for next year’s PURE hopefully.

**RR:** Now, there’s so much house and techno talent in Sydney where we’re based, and in Australia in general, but we feel it doesn’t get the recognition it deserves. Any thoughts on how the Australian underground electronic music scene can flourish?

**Carl: **It is really difficult, I remember [HMC](https://www.facebook.com/djhmc-13092400987/) from Adelaide, and Future Sound of Melbourne - Davide Carbone, Josh Abrahams and Steve Robbins as a unit… the list goes on actually. It’s so difficult for artists and labels to crossover, for instance to get [Richie Hawtin](https://www.facebook.com/richiehawtin/) to play anything by Australians. I always tried to play stuff from here, so I don’t know why it’s so hard for people. If you made a track in Berlin for a label that no one knew, Richie Hawtin would be all over it!

**RR: **We’re all about helping the Australian underground music scene. So how can we tackle that Carl?

**Carl: **It’s a tricky one, I’ve been trying to help the situation. We’re creating another new record label trying to sign artists from here. We just did [Babylon festival](https://www.facebook.com/babylonfestivalau/), and we had lots of Australian techno DJs playing and they’re bloody excellent! I scratch my head… I don’t know why labels (like [Pan Pot](https://www.facebook.com/PanPotOfficial/)’s label for example) are not picking up on some of this music. One man is no island, I can’t do everything but at least I can tell people - one of the reasons I’m in Australia is because there is a demand for my sound, now more than ever. We book Paco Osuna alongside local techno DJs to push them to the forefront too, which I think is really important. Eric Powell, with BUSH records tries his best to pick up on Australian talent, but it is difficult to get the music to crossover. We need another Juice record label that HMC was on that fires everything into Europe, or like when Future Sound of Melbourne had their label which tried to find techno tracks.
