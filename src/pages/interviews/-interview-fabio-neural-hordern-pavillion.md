**RR:** Hi Fabio – we’re really looking forward to your performance at PURE in April. What can we expect from your set?

**Fabio:** I can't wait to perform at this amazing festival me too! Well, I will  show all my skills during my set, trying to bring people in a trip and sharing with them the energy that music make me feel.

**RR:** Now Carl Cox, who is also performing has been a big supporter of your music. Has he been an influence for you?

**Fabio:** Yes, of course. Since the first time he asked me some demos for his label Intec, I always worked on doing something he will probably play, not focusing in only one genre but keeping my mind free as he do in his sets. As you know Carl can play techno, house or even funky. This thing also helped me a lot as nowadays it is so important to be openmind as music changes everyday.

**RR:** We gather this will be your first time in Australia – what have you got planned for your visit? Will you get any downtime to explore?

**Fabio:** Yes, it is. It will be my first time in Australia and I'm so excited about that. It always has been my dream to come there, I mean, the other part of the world! I love nature and animals and you have so many incredible things to see. I still don't know the plans of the tour but if I will have enough time I want to see something for sure. Any suggestions by the way? 

**RR:** Plenty - we'll send you a list haha! Now your monster hit, Kama, is featured in the PURE promo video. What was the concept behind the track?

**Fabio:** Kama was for me something that remind me when I was a young raver. The vocal I used is from an anthem track of 90's, 'Age of Love' that was played by all DJs during that period. I remember I listened Luciano and Pan-Pot playing it again and I thought: 'This track is still bomb and the vocal is amazing, but it needs a refresh' and I did it :) 

**RR:** Can you describe where you find inspiration when making music?

**Fabio:** Honestly I don't know. I don't have a method, you know, making music is creativity and it is impossible to force it. Sometimes I write a synth or I cut a vocal from a song and I start to build a groove from there, but what I do is simply leave things going on.

**RR:** We’ve been listening to your weekly radio show on Ibiza Global Radio – how did the whole thing start?

**Fabio:**  I remember the first time I played at Ibiza Global Radio was in 2007 when I won a d competition in Ibiza and they invited me to perform live. It was great for me, the first time playing in a radio (what a radio!) and answering the questions of David Moreno that was hosting the show. I started a friendship with him and all the times I came to Ibiza he always asked me to be part of his program. One day he sent me a text message and he asked me if I would like to have my own show and here we are, it is my fifth years!

**RR:** 
Tell us one track you like to play which always goes off.

**Fabio:** Well, for sure Dj Rolando - Jaguar & Technasia - Obsession (Hombre Lowdown French Kissed Edit) 

**RR:** You’ve played all over the world - is there a set that really stands out in your memory?

**Fabio:** When I played at Space in Ibiza for Carl Cox's The Final Chapter in 2016. For me it was a dream come true! The last season of his party in Ibiza, the last year of Space, playing in the Main Room: it was awesome!

**RR:** What have been the biggest challenges during your career?

**Fabio:** Honestly? Myself and life. I mean, in the world of music it is difficult to find someone that help you because everyone is scared by that you can take his place.

**RR:** I think it doesn't make sense, there are a lot of clubs and festivals for all, but it is, often people want more & more. But for me it wasn't a problem, the passion and the love I feel for music is so big that I did all the step, one to one, taking so many doors in the face, till now. I said myself and life because since I was 17 I had to cohabit with the cancer of my mother first and my father then. I lost her 10 years ago and him last year, so you can imagine the impact on my life and to music. As I told you before, you must be free and clear to make music and to focuse yourself into your career. For people it seems that being a dj is only play, sometimes making music and enjoying parties. But this is not the reality. There is a strong work behind if you decide to put your life into music. You have to make music of course, but reaching to release on top label (that it is what can help you doing the step up) is very difficult, a lot of people is making music and to much demos arrive to labels. You have to stay present on all socials network, doing the right posts at the right time. You have to contacts promoter of find an agency if you want to play. Make charts, interviews and listen to music to buy the best one everyday. And it is also very important to go to as much clubs and festivals as you can, to meet artists, label manager, bookers making connections and friendships. It is a waste of time and money. So life and the fight with myself to react to what happened to my life have been the biggest challenges, but I've been lucky to feel a true love for music. This is what give me the power to do not give up.

**RR:** Finally – what else is in your store for you this year?

**Fabio:** 2018 will be a important here for me not only because I finally refind myself after an amazing travel alone in Sri Lanka. I have joined Analog Agency for Spain, Portugal and Italy. I just played at Egg in London few weeks ago and released my rmx for the new label of Carl Cox and Christopher Coe that is going very well. I also close my eight Ep on Intec and one Ep on OFF Recordings.  I will perform with Carl in Italy at Afrobar in Sicily and in another important club that I cannot reveal yet. I will also take part at Creamfields Uk and Medusa Festival in Spain. But the biggest one is Pure Festival!! See you in Australia guys!

**RR:** We can't wait. See you soon Fabio!
