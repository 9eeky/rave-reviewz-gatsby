Undoubtedly one of the finest DJs doing the biz in sunny Sydney, we caught up with [WeLove](https://www.facebook.com/welovesydneyunderground/) front man [Nick Reverse](https://www.facebook.com/nickreverse/) for a chat about the brand and the things he loves...

**RR: **Hey Nick, happy new year! We saw you and your team smash it on New Year’s Day at [Space Ibiza on Tour](https://www.facebook.com/events/163826680868206/). How was the experience of hosting your own stage?

**Nick:** Space Ibiza was just amazing this year, we had the pleasure of taking over the Chapel with [Nakadia](https://www.facebook.com/djnakadia/) closing and such amazing local support... the dancefloor was on fire the whole time!

**RR:** Sure was. We’re super excited that one of the Space headliners - [Javi Bora](https://www.facebook.com/javiboramusic/), is playing at WeLove this week. What do you think we can we expect from him at the Burdekin? 

**Nick:** Javi always deliver the goods... his was my favourite set at Space Ibiza. I met him in 2016 and we became good friends. He’s already played three gigs for us and we’re really looking forward to having him play for us again on Friday.

**RR:** WeLove has grown to become one of Sydney’s finest underground music institutions. How did the whole thing start?

**Nick:** It started in June 2015 at the [Burdekin](https://www.facebook.com/BurdekinHotel/) as a weekly meeting for techno lovers that became a solid party. Then we had our first official afterparty for Space Ibiza on New Years Day 2016 and things took off…

**RR:** Nice. If you had to pick one of your parties that really hit the spot for you which would it be?

**Nick:**  That's a pretty hard question... I have so many good memories! Last Friday with Nakadia was so great… and I’ll never forget the 5 hour set by [Markantoni](https://www.facebook.com/djmarkantonio/)o & [Luigi Madonna](https://www.facebook.com/LuigiMadonnaBeat/)… and many others!

**RR:** And if you could bring down anyone for a WeLove party, who would you choose?

Nick: There are so many good artists. We’re working on a few… let's keep it a secret for the moment haha.

**RR:** Fair enough! Let’s talk about your own music career – how did you get into DJing? 

**Nick:** My dad had some turntables with heaps of funk which started my passion. At the age of 18 I started to play private parties, then clubs, and within a few years producing music became my life! I released my first EP and started to perform in Italy and Europe... then I moved to Australia when I was 25 and I think it was one of the best decisions I’ve made.

**RR:** You’ve built a reputation for delivering some very energetic sets. Which of the sets you’ve played is the most memorable for you?

**Nick:** I had a great time at [Subsonic](https://www.facebook.com/subsonicmusic/) Festival… and the terrace at [S.A.S.H](https://www.facebook.com/sashsundays/) a couple of years ago… also every time I play at WeLove I feel that energy.

**RR:** You started a WeLove Recordings imprint earlier this year and released some stellar tracks including one of your own, [Sun & Rain](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Frelease%2Fsun-and-rain%2F1971225&h=ATM-yj0WWnDsT7uAXRmzkeLF9kZt4w3BqP_7-O6_3QkyTbC7GPbi6722MJQLhK8agOr-0O-FceeopDTpjaVUJ40sH3gG0FkR9up9G5Xed5DForMyWBenqbkF). Tell us where the inspiration for the track came from.

**Nick:** The track came to me one day while I started to play with this synth and thought about how good it would be to have your own record label… so we did it!

**RR:** Awesome. What else can we look forward to from the label?

**Nick:** You guys should definitely check out our next release from Javi Bora, which is out very soon!

**RR: **Will do… and finally, what’s your new year’s resolution??

**Nick:** We have a big vision for WeLove in 2018 with many surprises and collaborations… we had a great start to the year at Space Ibiza plus our first takeover at The Bridge Hotel. This year is going to be unreal…

**RR:** Look forward to seeing it all take shape. Thanks for the chat mate!
