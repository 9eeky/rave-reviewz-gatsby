Our chat with Seb Zito
<br><br>

**Thanks for joining us Seb. You’re set for a busy Australia tour that culminates in the Canvas party at the Civic. What do you have in store for us?**

Seb: I tend to mix things up a bit, throw in some Garage, 2step, Breakbeats etc. along with the Fuse sound, few House classics and a little sprinkle of Techno. Going by previous experiences in Sydney you guys sure know how to party, so I know the energy will be there from the start.
<br><br>

**The Canvas boys will be celebrating their 3rd Birthday at the event ... how did you celebrate your last birthday??**

Seb: I don't know how but I manage to long my birthdays out for a week. I can't even remember exactly what I did!!! It was over Easter bank holiday, so it was definitely messy.
<br><br> 

**You were here last year playing a B2B set with Enzo at the inaugural ‘Days Like This’. How was your experience of the Australian festival vibe?**

Seb:** **I loved the festival, like I said earlier you guys really know how to party and put a lot of energy into raving. You're also open to varied sounds, which could see from the line-up also.
<br><br>

**We liked your mix for Rinse FM recently, which featured a preview of your upcoming track 'On it' set for release on Seth Troxler's label later this year. How did the collaboration come about? Can you tell us about the concept behind the track?  **

Seb:** **Enzo was the one who brought the vocalist into the studio around 3 years ago and he never really finished the track. I think one day I was working on a project and, as I do get easily distracted, started playing around with the vocals Enzo recorded. I actually created 2 separate tracks one called "Watching You" (which is also on that mix) & "On It". I think from this Enzo went and finished his version, or it could have been finished before but I can't really remember. Either way Dice was meant to sign it to Desolat but that fell through and basically after that, the tracks were forgotten about. But recently I started playing the track out again and started to send it out to other DJ's as a promo. Seth picked up on it & really pushed the track, I think he played it in pretty much every set, so it was a no brainer really that he signed it.

To think that this was so close to being one of those forgotten projects, just shows perseverance pays off.

**We had a chat with Rossko earlier this month and he told us the FUSE residents road-test a lot of upcoming releases on the label when on tour.  Which tracks are you dropping at the moment?**

Seb:** **"Slapdash" one of my personal favourites which is coming out on Eats Everythings Edible. "Garvage" is a big build up/drop kinda track, goes off every time I play it, this one will be out on Fuse probably next year. “Cold Fingertips" is a 2step vocal track, which will be out on my Seven Dials label.
<br><br>

**FUSE has come a long way since establishing itself as an afterparty at 93 Feet East. What ingredients do you think have led to the brand's success?  **

I think it’s down to many factors: strength of the label and releases, quality of the music, quality of DJ sets, door management, crowd control, sound, venues. All of these are needed to be successful in my opinion.
<br><br>

**We've had some unfortunate events recently in Sydney with the police threatening to refuse entry to punters at an electronic music event based on sniffer dogs suspecting them of carrying drugs, without any actual proof. Having run events in London for many years, did you ever experience anything like that? What are your thoughts on the police taking that approach?**

Seb: Only time I've seen sniffer dogs is either at a large festival or at the airport. No place for it outside a club, that’s just ridiculous. People will take drugs whether the authorities like it or not, better off making the environment safe and having help at hand if anything goes wrong, rather then using these scare tactics.
<br><br>

**Your label Seven Dial Records, which we presume was named after your 2011 EP, is doing big things. How would you say its music policy and style differ to the FUSE brands?**

Seb: Yes it’s kinda tied into my first EP on Fuse but also my local youth club where I used to play records to my friends, that’s where everything started for me. It’s more leaning towards a UK sound, mainly Garage, Breakbeat, 2Step, Dubstep etc where Fuse is more towards Techno & House.
<br><br> 

**Big question - If we asked you to select one set that stands out in your memories, what springs to mind?**

Seb:** **Wow so many sets but most recently it was the  Fuse part 2 at the Hangar (Mangle). Played for 3 hours and it just flowed perfectly, no thinking, pausing just track after track of seamless flow.

**Finally, with the World Cup under way... how do you think England will do? Reckon Australia have more chance of winning??**

Seb: Going by how crap everyone else is doing i’d say England have a good chance. No Italy or Holland and Germany playing so bad I think we have a better chance than anyone but as you know England always blow it.
