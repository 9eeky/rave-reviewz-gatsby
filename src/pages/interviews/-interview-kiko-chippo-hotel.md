**RR:** Great to chat Kiko â€“ weâ€™re looking forward to your performance this weekend. What kind of set can we expect from you?

**Kiko:** I am going to play a lot of my own production ðŸ™‚ iâ€™m also going to try out some new tracks of mine

**RR: **You've played in Australia a few times - how were those experiences?

**Kiko:** It's been about 5 or 6 times that Iâ€™ve played in Australia. I also played at the Babylon Festival last year. I was with my old friend The Hacker! I love playing in Australia, people are very receptive to the music I play. My true first time in Australia was in Sydney and Melbourne in 2002 or 2003.

**RR:** Now you ran a record store called Ozone in the 90s. What was the dance scene like back then in Grenoble? 

**Kiko:** I had opened a record shop in Grenoble in 1994, and thanks to this shop, I met The Hacker, Miss Kittin and Oxia, who are all from Grenoble. Itâ€™s with oxia that we set up our first record label Ozone in 1995. Later we created the goodlife label in 1997 with The Hacker and Oxia. Then finally we created our group Phunky Data (Oxia and I) in 1998.

**RR:** You've dabbled in multiple genres from new wave to techno and electro to italo disco. What made you experiment with so many different styles?

**Kiko:** Yes in Grenoble we love italo disco, because Grenoble is not very far from Italy . My reference group is of course on Depeche mode. My tracks are full of these influences.

**RR: **We gather that you have produced over 500 tracks! How do you keep finding fresh ideas for music?

**Kiko:** Music is like a therapy for me, I work every day in my Bunker (studio) and iâ€™ve been doing that for 24 years now! I need to create, it's vital for me.

**RR:** You have a track with Thomas Gandey due out next month. Can you tell us a bit about the collaboration?

**Kiko:** I've met Thomas Gandey via facebook, he had already produced tracks with my friend Olivier Giacomotto! I love his voice! As Iâ€™ve worked with Oliver Giacomotto since quite a few years now, naturally i needed to work something out with Thomas Gandey! We had a track which was released in February on Suara Records and we have another track that will be released on the 20th of April for Stil Vor Talent.

**RR: **You also have a side project called 'Minota' which is signed under Miguel Campbell's label. What is the concept behind it?

**Kiko: **I was already doing house music 20 years ago with Oxia, under the name of Phunky Data . I know Miguel Campbell very well , he's like family to me  and I love his label Outcross Records.

**RR: **Having worked in the music business for many years, what would you say has been the key to your longevity? 

**Kiko: **To work and and to never give up! And of course, be well surrounded (booker, manager, agent press ..)

**RR:** And across your extensive career, which gig has been the most memorable for you?

**Kiko:** In 2011 and 2012, I toured with Carl Cox for 2 years, it was such an epic experience.

**RR: **Finally - what else have you got coming up this year?

**Kiko: **This year I am going to focus a lot on production!

**RR: ** We'll let you let go Kiko. Thanks for chatting!

**Kiko: **Thanks for having me.
