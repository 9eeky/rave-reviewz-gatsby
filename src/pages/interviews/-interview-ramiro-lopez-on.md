**RR: Hey Ramiro, we're looking forward to seeing you play at the Spektrum x Vivid Music event at Burdekin Hotel. We gather this is your first time playing in Sydney… what do you have planned for the visit?**

It’s actually my first time ever in Australia and I’m really excited! I’ve heard great things about the country and specially from Sydney. I wanna take advantage of my time here (even though it will be very short) Visiting some beautiful places, trying some local tasty food and of course making the people coming to the parties have an unforgettable time.
<br><br>

**RR: Now, you launched your own label, 'Odd Recordings' with Arjun Vagale in 2017, which is described as an "Indo-Spanish cross-pollinized record label bringing you futuristic music with an emphasis on the raw side of techno". Can you tell us about the birth of the imprint? What challenges have you faced since its conception?**

Odd Rec is pretty new. We launched the label at the beginning of 2017 and honestly we are amazed about how it is going on. There so many quality labels out there and even if you are doing a good job, is difficult to get the attention of the scene. We are releasing only music we believe in and love to play and it seems many people share our taste so we are happy about it.
<br><br>

**RR: Odd Recordings has started a new series called 'Especial' releasing just one track at a time, including your energetic offering 'Tight'. What is the philosophy behind the series? And what do you look for in a track to feature it? **

The idea with these series is release something strong, “especial” as the Spanish word means, giving all the attention to one single track. Looking for those tracks that make the difference whenever you are playing them.
<br><br>

**RR: Rewinding back a bit, you released your first solo EP 'Pretending' on Adam Beyer's legendary Drumcode label in 2015. What impact do you think this had on your career?**

Drumcode has been my goal for many years. I love the label and deeply admire Adam. I feel so proud to have been released there. Is one of the best labels in the world and very well known. Signing music on it means you´ll reach many new people that following from there. It has been a very important step for sure.
<br><br>

**RR: Your remix for Moby with Coyu was an amazing piece of music and a great opportunity for you, no doubt. Can you tell us how it come about?**

This came mainly 'cause ‘Y.E.A.H. ‘ , the collab I made along with Coyu. The track was pretty successful and turned out to be one of Moby’s favourite ones back these days. He posted about it on his socials (was on shock when I found out). After this, his manager contacted ours to ask for the remix and of course we accepted.
<br><br>

**RR: Your music style is hard to categorise - containing a mix of house, techno, groove and even RnB….where do you draw your influences from, especially when you're in the studio?**

I like pretty much every music style if it's quality. I love listening to jazz and bossa nova on the background whenever I’m cooking for example. Inspiration would come everywhere: a movie, television , a song in the radio while you are at the gym... I have my phone full of voice notes.
<br><br>

**RR: What steps do you take to ensure that you as an artist and your sound are constantly evolving?**

I’m always listening what other artists are doing, not only the ones close to my style. Trying hard to go one step further every time I’m starting a track, making something different. It's also important  to be open to learn.
<br><br>

**RR: You've come a long way since your first official gig ever in 1999 in a club called Timba in the Spanish city of Toledo. Besides that one are there any other clubs that have a special place in your heart? And what would you say is the most memorable set you’ve played over the years?**

I spent more than 4 years at Family Club, the most famous club in the area where I live. I learnt a lot during that period. Florida 135 is also one that I also love, magic place for techno. Can’t wait to go back there. Playing at Space Ibiza just one year before it disappeared was also a dream come true.

Regarding the set ,it’s hard to remember just one. Last Saturday at Fabrik on the Carl Cox Party for example was one for the books
<br><br>

**RR: During all these years of making music and sharing it through your performances, what would you say is the most important lesson you've learned?**

Be always humble and treat everyone with respect and be grateful with the people supporting and following you and coming to your shows, you are there because of them.
<br><br>

**RR: Finally, what's on your horizon for the rest of 2018?**

Keep working in Odd recordings to make it better and better, work on another Drumcode record, visit lot of exciting places, make the people dance all around the world,  and basically enjoy the best job in the world to me.
