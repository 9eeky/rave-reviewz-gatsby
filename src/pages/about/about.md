##About Us

![](/img/rave-reviewz-team.jpg)

Kamran had the idea for RAVE REVIEWZ - a search & review site for parties and festivals when he found it difficult to find reliable information on good underground electronic music events to go to. After working on the site for some time, he met Sean, who heads up the marketing. Charlotte & Nick joined the team as interns and now the RR squad is busy promoting and covering the underground electronic music scene in Sydney!
