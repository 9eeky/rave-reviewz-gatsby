We love innovation in Sydney’s underground electronic scene, so we were stoked to hear that the guys over at [Sydney’s Eyes](https://www.facebook.com/SydneysEyes/) are launching a new Youtube show “All Eyes on Us” to showcase local talent. 
<br>

Sydney’s eyes launched as a brand this year with the intention of bringing together a range of underground sounds under one banner - from house & techno, to latin and reggaeton. Their first event at King’s Cross Hotel featured the likes of Jaman of Sideboob, Joey London and Sydney’s eyes front man - Sam Ritter.

Sam hails from Israel but honed his DJ skills in London where he landed a recording contract and performed at the Egg nightclub amongst other well-known stomping grounds. He then did the rounds in Poland, Hawaii and Japan before becoming a familiar face on the Sydney circuit. Sam met Sydney’s Eyes co-founder Isaac Antebi in Hawaii and the two have been planning new ways to bring good music to the masses ever since.

We featured Sam on the Rave Reviewz show a while ago when he smashed a mix for us on Bondi Beach, check it out below...

Sam explained the idea behind All Eyes on Us when we caught up with him… “We want it to be an open stage for DJs in Sydney, to help them showcase their skills and expose them to wider audiences, in an effort to help promote them worldwide”. Isaac added “the artists playing in each showcase include talented DJs starting out alongside two well known DJs whose names are only revealed 24 hours before the show”. ...The suspense!
<br>

The first edition of the show is at Monkey Magic this Saturday 3rd November, with Frederick Gallagher, Ulia, Dr Mood and Sam Ritter warming up for the mystery headliners. With halloween costumes encouraged and prizes on offer for best outfit, we reckon there are bound to be a few ‘ghost of Tupac’ ensembles at All Eyes on Us!
